## 3/30

Took the newly repaired Fuji GW690 to the Mulholland Wildflower Preserve. Beautiful day, pleasant hike, took a few nice images. Film used was Ilford HP5, developed in Ilford DDX 1+4, 9 minutes at 68 degrees. Results were ideal, with one issue: there seems to be a bright line running through the film. It was a line, so I could rule out anything lens-related; the line was not entirely parallel to the film advance, so it should not be any bumps in the film pressure plate or anywhere inside the camera. My conjecture is that there was some small dust on the squeegee I used, which scratched the film. To be safe, I will consider not using squeegee for 120 film next time.

Some nice images.
