## 3/30

Took the newly repaired Fuji GW690 to the Mulholland Wildflower Preserve. Beautiful day, pleasant hike, took a few nice images. Film used was Ilford HP5, developed in Ilford DDX 1+4, 9 minutes at 68 degrees. Results were ideal, with one issue: there seems to be a bright line running through the film. It was a line, so I could rule out anything lens-related; the line was not entirely parallel to the film advance, so it should not be any bumps in the film pressure plate or anywhere inside the camera. My conjecture is that there was some small dust on the squeegee I used, which scratched the film. To be safe, I will consider not using squeegee for 120 film next time.

Some images.

Metered on the woods, took three shots for different exposures. Looking back, should have shot it when the sun was directly hitting the forest -- for a flatter scene.

Second time here. Still hard to compose at this scene. It would be nice if I could go into the water a bit. Will try next time.
