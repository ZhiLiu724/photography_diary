# Photography notes during April, 2022

## 4/19

Got a bunch of film back from Nice. This includes:

3 rolls of Ektar 100:

- 1 roll shot on Fuji GW690 in Pittsburgh, sample photos: [Cityscape in Pittsburgh, PA](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc45ECpO7jg/)
  - I am overall pleased with how these photos turned out. It seems that the GW690 lens does render color better with newer coating.
- 1 roll shot on Rolleicord in Pittsburgh and in the Adirondacks, sample photos: [Tree in Heaven Hill Trails](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cck3HlRrCuc/)
  - The saturation seems to be a bit too much with the Rollei lens. Overall I am not too pleased with the results, particularly with the flares in a couple photos.
- 1 roll shot on Rolleicord in the Adirondacks, sample photos: [Some lush vegetation found on Cobble Hill, Lake Placid, NY](https://www.instagram.com/p/CdC2tgJOCrc/)
  - Same comments as above. Although this time it could also be the scanning process, seems like the highlight areas are being cut out a lot.

1 roll of Cinestill 800T:

- Shot on Nikon FE2 with the Voightlander 58mm f/1.4 lens. Primarily in Ithaca. Sample photos: [McGraw Tower](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ccy3kjwLWZX/)
  - This film might be a bit too harsh for daylight use, although they seem to have turned out okay, I am not particularly a fan of the color fringing.

1 roll of Kodak ProImage 100:

- Shot on Nikon FE2 with 50mm f/1.8 Series E lens and the Voightlander lens above. Both in NYC and in Ithaca. Sample photos: [Streets of NYC](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ccy2-NzrOfm/) [A foggy day in NYC](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcnhjtELsax/)
  - Overall very please with the results, does not seem to have particularly fine grain for a 100-speed film, but the grain and white balance are typical 'film'.





## 4/21

Went to Piglet's corner north of campus. Drizzling. Packed the Fuji GW690 with some Ilford HP5+. Standard processing. Sample photos: [Collection of pictures](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cco2-p6LRZb/), [A group of pine cone trees in Newman Arboretum](https://www.instagram.com/p/CdC4ICMuore/).

Noticed on the earlier shots that their is a dark slide on the upper quarter of the frames. My guess is that this was most likely from the moisture that day. The later shots were okay, so would rule out camera light leaks.
